## General Information
This project focuses on developing a custom CNN model for melanoma detection, a deadly skin cancer responsible for 75% of skin cancer deaths. Using a dataset of 2357 images with nine different skin diseases from ISIC, we aim to automate early diagnosis. The project follows a structured pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, augmentation, and handling class imbalances. The goal is to improve accuracy, reduce misdiagnosis, and assist dermatologists in detecting melanoma efficiently. By leveraging deep learning and computer vision, this model can enhance early detection and patient outcomes.

## Technologies Used

pathlib – (for handling file paths)
tensorflow – (for building and training the deep learning model)
matplotlib.pyplot – (for visualizing images and model performance)
numpy – (for numerical computations)
pandas – (for data manipulation and analysis)
os – (for interacting with the operating system)
PIL (Pillow) – (for image processing)
tensorflow.keras – (for building the CNN architecture using layers and models)
tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator – (for data augmentation and preprocessing)

These libraries support image preprocessing, deep learning model training, and performance evaluation for melanoma classification

## conclusions
This project combines deep learning, computer vision, and medical imaging to develop a powerful melanoma detection system. The CNN model will help dermatologists diagnose skin cancer more efficiently, ultimately saving lives through early detection.
